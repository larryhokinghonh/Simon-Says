# Simon Says ðŸ‘¨

## I. Introduction

A game similar to the children game Simon Says developed into a website application. This game website application is inspired by the Simon Game challenge in Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp online course. 

## II. Getting Started

Here is the link to the website application: https://simon-says-64mp.onrender.com/

The website may take a while to load if the website has not been visited in the past 15 minutes. This is because Render would shut down the servers after 15 minutes of server inactivity. 
(I would love the server to be active 24/7 but I am poor. Beggars can't be choosers. Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯)

## III. Features

- Built-in Volume Bar
- Live Global Leaderboard
- Search User Scores
- **Tutorial Video (New!)**

## IV. Technologies Used

This website application is built with **HTML/CSS**, **Embedded JavaScript (EJS) + jQuery**, **NodeJS** and **ExpressJS**.

## V. Others

Feel free to explore the source code for the website application in the repository. Any feedback is very much appreciated. The aim of developing this simple website application is for me to familarize myself with JavaScript, EJS, jQuery and explore more about CSS by incoporating animations. Additionally, I got to use MySQL to store the data for the user leaderboard and connect it with ExpressJS to the website application.
